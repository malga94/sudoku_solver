# sudoku_solver
A simple python script to solve a sudoku board.

The input board needs to be placed in the board.txt file. The syntax is
comma separated values, with newlines after each row of the board. Dots
('.') mean an empty cell.

The sudoku_validator script reads this file and verifies if the input sudoku board satisfies the rules of sudoku. The sudoku_solver script
implements a backtracking algorithm to solve the board.

I am planning to add a simple GUI in the future
